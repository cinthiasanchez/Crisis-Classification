## Label mapping by dataset

We unify the original labels into the most general task in order to maintain consistency. Similar to CrisisLexT6, ChileEarthquakeT1 and Ecuador-Earthquake datasets, our criteria for labeling the messages was by relatedness to crisis events. The original labels are shown as they appear in the datasets. Most of the data was labeled for humanitarian aid purposes, so we removed a tweet corresponding to the 'Animal management' label from CrisisNLP_R1 (volunteers) dataset.
